### Fixed — booking page showed stale system fee (₱20 instead of admin-set ₱15)

- **Root cause:** the system has two fee tables — a legacy `system_fee_settings` history table and a newer `system_settings` singleton. Admin's settings form writes to the singleton, but `findCurrentSystemFeeCentavos` (which the public booking page calls to display the fee estimate) was still reading from the legacy table. Booking creation already read from the correct singleton, so bookings were *charging* ₱15 while the page *displayed* ₱20 — a trust-breaking mismatch.
- **Fix:** `findCurrentSystemFeeCentavos` now delegates to `getCurrentBookingFeeRule()` (the single source of truth). Legacy table only used as fallback if the singleton row is missing (test fixtures / un-migrated envs).

### Admin (system) dashboard — audit + polish

- Audited `/admin/*` end-to-end: all 15 routes load real DB data, all 14 server actions guarded by `requireAdmin()`, audit logging on every mutation, double-entry ledger intact, optimistic concurrency throughout, query scoping correct (admin sees everything; not filtered by owner_id).
- **Added** loading.tsx for all 5 admin detail pages (venues, users, bookings, payouts, invoices) — previously users saw a blank screen during the multi-join DB queries.
- **Fixed** invoice receipt image eager-loads on the admin invoice detail page (was `lazy`, felt slow on a page where the receipt IS the primary content).
- Files:
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/admin/venues/[id]/loading.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/admin/users/[id]/loading.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/admin/bookings/[id]/loading.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/admin/payouts/[id]/loading.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/admin/invoices/[id]/loading.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/admin/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`

### Owner dashboard — audit + polish

- Ran end-to-end audit of `/owner/*` pages: all routes load real DB data, all forms wired to real server actions, RLS/authorization checks confirmed throughout, optimistic concurrency intact.
- **Added** prominent warning Alert on payment review card when receipt amount doesn't match expected total — previously the mismatch was only a tiny red text easy to miss when verifying GCash payments.
- **Added** loading state for `/owner/venues/[id]/courts/new` route (was missing — users saw blank while form loaded).
- Files:
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/owner/payments/review-card.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/owner/venues/[id]/courts/loading.tsx` (new)

### Removed — CAPTCHA disabled across all forms

- **Why:** Private launch with ~100 invited users — bot signup/spam is not a realistic threat at this scale. The CAPTCHA was causing real users on mobile / distant networks to get stuck on "Security check failed".
- **Server:** `verifyTurnstileToken` now hard-returns `{ success: true, skipped: true }` regardless of environment. Original logic preserved below the early return so re-enabling is a one-line revert later.
- **Client:** `<TurnstileWidget>` removed from sign-up, sign-in, forgot-password, and invoice-receipt forms.
- Files:
  - `apps/web/src/lib/turnstile.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/owner/invoices/[id]/pay-form.tsx`

### Fixed — Turnstile failing on mobile / distant networks

- **Issue:** Users on Android browsers from regions far from their usual location (e.g. ~200km away) were seeing "Security check failed — please retry" with no visible CAPTCHA to solve.
- **Root cause:** The Turnstile widget was rendered with `appearance: "interaction-only"`, which keeps the iframe invisible. When Cloudflare's risk engine flags a session (mobile carriers, unfamiliar geos, older Android WebViews) it requires the user to complete an interactive challenge — but with the widget hidden, there was nothing to click, so no token was ever produced.
- **Fix:** Changed appearance to `"always"`. Low-risk sessions still complete silently (brief "Verifying…" spinner), and flagged sessions now get a visible challenge they can actually solve.
- File: `apps/web/src/components/turnstile-widget.tsx`

### Fixed — Sign-up email verification link

- Added explicit `emailRedirectTo` on `supabase.auth.signUp` so the confirmation link in the verification email points to our `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL/sign-in` instead of relying on Supabase's dashboard "Site URL" fallback.
- File: `apps/web/src/features/auth/service.ts`
- **Action required in Supabase dashboard** (see notes below) to enable confirmation emails.

### Added — Booking detail page redesign (`/me/bookings/[id]`)

- **Hero card** with venue cover photo, gradient overlay, prominent status badge, and venue identity (avatar + name + address)
- **4-step progress bar** (Submitted → Under Review → Confirmed → Completed) derived from booking status and end time
- **Redesigned Booking Summary** card with prominent date, court schedule with indoor/outdoor badge, time range, duration, and itemized total (court fee, system fee, total paid)
- **Action buttons** (2×2 grid):
  - **Add to Calendar** — generates `.ics` file client-side and triggers download
  - **Get Directions** — opens Google Maps directions (uses venue coords when set, falls back to address search)
  - **Contact Venue** — `tel:` link to venue owner's phone (graceful "No phone listed" state when missing)
  - **View Receipt** — opens signed receipt URL in a new tab
- Owner phone now fetched via a small `profiles.phoneE164` lookup keyed on `venue.ownerId`

### Files

- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/me/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` — full visual redesign; all existing functionality (status alerts, payment receipt card, review form, cancel button, "Pay now" CTA) preserved
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/me/bookings/_components/booking-action-buttons.tsx` — new client component (RFC 5545 ICS builder + 4 action tiles)

## 2026-05-16

### Fixed — Payment submission flow

- Silent failure when no receipt file was attached → now returns `"file_required"` with a clear inline error
- Missing error display on rejection responses → errors now surface to the player
- Double-submit causing `"booking is payment_submitted"` error → added `disabled` state via shared `SubmitButton` (driven by `useFormStatus`) and a `pendingLabel` spinner during upload
- Slow submit perceived as a hang → email/SMS notifications deferred via Next's `after()` so the response returns before sending. Applied to `submit`, `verify`, and `reject` actions.

### Build/deploy

- Fixed stray `}` in `apps/web/src/app/(app)/venues/[slug]/book/booking-flow.tsx` Alert import that broke the Vercel build
- Vercel: disabled "Require Log In" deployment protection; git author email aligned with GitHub account
